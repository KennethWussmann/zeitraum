# Development

## Releasing

The release of `@zeitraum/client` is automated using [`changesets`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Just merge the publish PR.

The release of `@zeitraum/cli` requires a GitHub release with a tag in format `*.*.*`, for example `1.2.4`. The cli publish workflow will upload the binaries to that GitHub release once it's done.
The title of the release should be `@zeitraum/cli@*.*.*` and the body is auto-generated by GitHub.
