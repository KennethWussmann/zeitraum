# ðŸš¢ `@zeitraum/server`

The heart of Zeitraum is the server. It's a dockerized GraphQL and REST API service that can be deployed even on lower-end devices like Raspberry Pis.

## Docker Compose

Here is an example on how to deploy Zeitraum via Docker Compose.

```YAML
version: '3.8'
services:
  # Zeitraum requires a Postgres database.
  database:
    image: postgres:15
    volumes:
      - database:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: zeitraum
      POSTGRES_USER: zeitraum
      POSTGRES_DB: zeitraum

  server:
    # For available versions check the latest releases
    image: ghcr.io/kennethwussmann/zeitraum/server:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    depends_on:
      - database
    environment:
      # Check the enviroment variables guide below for more infos about available settings
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://zeitraum:zeitraum@database:5432/zeitraum
      API_TOKENS: fdHww82okrvB,XOEDNXE5MHiB
    # optional health check
    healthcheck:
      test: node health-check.mjs
      interval: 30s
      retries: 1
      start_period: 60s
      timeout: 10s

volumes:
  database:
```

## API

### GraphQL

When the API client doesn't work for the implemention, GraphQL is the way to go. It's super easy to implement and [many languages have great tooling](https://graphql.org/code/) to make it simple.

Check out the schema here: [Open Schema](./src/api/graphql/schema.graphql)

### REST

Less fun and more work, but of course Zeitraum has a REST API as well. This is handy for limited environments where one can do an HTTP request but does not have a great programming environment, for example iOS Shortcuts.

To get the OpenAPI spec, open this URL on your Zeitraum instance:

```
https://your-zeitraum.com/openapi.json?token=<API-TOKEN>
```

> Replace `your-zeitraum.com` with your URL where your installation lives and `<API-TOKEN>` with an API token

## Prometheus

The Zeitraum server has a `/metrics` endpoint that can be scraped by Prometheus. This is a great way to add observability to your spent time. This opens Zeitraum to many more use cases:

- Get a Slack/Discord/Telegram/etc. notification when you work more than 8 hours today or to take a break from work
- Build beautiful Grafana dashboard to get an overview on your spent time

Setup a scraping job in your Prometheus config:

```YML
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "zeitraum"
    scheme: https
    metrics_path: /metrics
    authorization:
      credentials: "fdHww82okrvB..." # set API Token
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["your-zeitraum.com"] # adjust location
```

> **Notice**: Prometheus is another service that you need to deploy and configure in order to leverage more capabilities. Check this project for an [example deployment](https://github.com/vegasbrianc/prometheus/).

## iCal Export

The server can export all completed time spans as iCal calendar. This allows to keep track of where time has been spent in the past and can be synchronized with many calendar clients.

The iCal can be downloaded from this URL. Replace the server url and API token:

```
https://your-zeitraum.com/calendar/admin.ical?token=<API-TOKEN>
```

> Hint: You don't need to adjust `admin.ical`. Currently only one internal user exists, which is admin. You only change the server and set the API token.

## Health Check

The server exposes an additional webserver. By default on port `9000` that allows scraping by health checks. It's a different server port, because it does not require authentication. A health check ensures that traffic is only routed to the container when it's ready to serve it. The Zeitraum container will be marked as unready/unhealthy when the database connection is not established or disconnects.

It has three endpoints `/health`, `/live`, `/ready`. Read more about their behaviour in the [Lightship docs](https://github.com/gajus/lightship#health).
